# create-rails-app

Interactive CLI wizard for `rails new` — work in progress.

Will walk you through every option, save presets, and remember your choices. No more `rails new` flags look-ups!

Sibling project: [create-ruby-gem](https://github.com/svyatov/create-ruby-gem) — the same idea for `bundle gem`.

## Installation

gem install create-rails-app
